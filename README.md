# GAMES MASTER

This is a Lewagon final project, with [Camila-mallmann](https://github.com/Camila-mallmann), [abdl242](https://github.com/abdl242) and [myself](https://github.com/Hip-po)

## The project

The goal is to create an AI that learns from nothing how to play different gyms using Reinforcement Learning.

We decided to start with an easy rac car game to understand and master RL theory and pytorch.

Then we will apply our new knowledges on other games.

## Racing car

This game is pretty simple. All the AI has to do is to follow a race track.

As long as the car follow the roads, it betters its reward. But if it does nothing or goes off track, the score is penalized.

To reach the best possible score, we tried different model and way to make our AI learn.
